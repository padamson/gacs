abstract  ="A review is presented of the design and application of genetic algorithms for the geometry optimisation of clusters and nanoparticles{,} where the interactions between atoms{,} ions or molecules are described by a variety of potential energy functions. A general introduction to genetic algorithms is followed by a detailed description of the genetic algorithm program that we have developed to identify the lowest energy isomers for a variety of atomic and molecular clusters. Examples are presented of its application to model Morse clusters{,} ionic MgO clusters and bimetallic {"}nanoalloy{"} clusters. Finally{,} a number of recent innovations and possible future developments are discussed."}

A flowchart representing the operation of the genetic algorithm used in the program is shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:flowchart}. The algorithm follows Johnston.\cite{johnston} Specific features are described below.

\subsection{Generate Initial Population}

For a given cluster size (nuclearity $N$), an initial population of $N_{pop}$ clusters ($10<N_{pop}<30$) are generated
randomly. The $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates are chosen randomly in the range $[0,N^{1/3}]$, ensuring that the cluster
size scales linearly with $N$.

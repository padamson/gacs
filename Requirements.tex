The scope of this application is the search for optimized geometries of clusters and nanoparticles using
genetic algorithms to drive quantum chemistry calculations. The basic approach follows Johnston.\cite{johnston}

The code shall do the following:

\begin{description}
  \item[\req{1}] generate an initial population of clusters in which the real-valued cartesian coordinates 
    are the cluster atoms as the genes and
    \begin{description}
      \item[\req{1.1}] by choosing the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates randomly in the range $[0,N^{1/3}]$ and 
      \item[\req{1.2}] relaxing each cluster in the initial population to local minima using the 
        quasi-Newton L-BFGS minimisation routine
    \end{description}
  \item[\req{2}] for a generation, record the lowest and highest values of the potential energy; compute the fitness 
    using dynamic fitness scaling with
    \begin{description}
      \item[\req{2.1}] an exponential fitness function
      \item[\req{2.2}] a linear fitness function
      \item[\req{2.3}] a hyperbolic tangent fitness function
    \end{description}
  \item from a generation with assigned fitness values, select parents for crossover using
    \begin{description}
      \item[\req{3.1}] roulette wheel selection
      \item[\req{3.2}] tournament selection
    \end{description}
  \item[\req{4}] carry out crossover for a given set of parents, generating a predetermined number of offspring, 
    using a variant of the cut and splice crossover operator of Deaven and Ho followed by relaxation to a local
    minimum using the quasi-Newton L-BFGS routing
  \item for a set of offspring, apply a mutation with a predetermined probability, and relax any ``mutant'' clusters
    using the L-BFGS minimisation routine; the applied mutation scheme is
    \begin{description}
      \item[\req{5.1}] atom displacement
      \item[\req{5.2}] twisting
      \item[\req{5.3}] cluster replacement
      \item[\req{5.4}] atom permutation
    \end{description}
  \item[\req{6}] maintain diversity in the offspring population by removing the higher energy offspring of any pair with
    difference in energy of less than some predetermined value
  \item[\req{7}] select a next generation of predetermined size from the lowest energy (highest fitness) 
    clusters selected from the set containing the previous generation, the new offspring, and the new mutants
  \item[\req{8}] repeat crossover, mutation, and selection for a specified number of generations or until convergence
    (range of cluster energies in the population has not changed for a prescribed number of generations)
\end{description}
